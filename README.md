# BlockAnnouncer
This plugin sends a broadcasted message when a player mines a block that has been specified in the 'config.yml'. You have the choice to either allow all worlds to get affected or only the worlds thats in the array.

# How is it useful?
In a survival setting players who have discovered diamonds can announce to the server they had found diamond ore. This can be used as a way to detect xray aswell.

# Public plugins
Some plugins I release may require the Core plugin which **will not** be released to the public anytime soon!
